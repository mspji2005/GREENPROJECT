          What is Earthchain?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Earthchain is a platform where every transaction represents a verified eco-action, such as planting a tree or reducing carbon emissions. We aim to reward tangible environmental impact with digital tokens.

          Why Itâ€™s Unique
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Unlike traditional systems, Earthchain focuses on "Proof-of-Impact" rather than energy-intensive "Proof-of-Work". This approach brings transparency and a layer of gamification to climate actions, encouraging more people to participate in making a positive environmental difference.
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>**Transparency:** All verified actions are recorded.</li>
          <li>**Gamification:** Earn tokens for your contributions.</li>
          <li>**Energy Efficiency:** Rewards impact directly, not computational power.</li>
        </ul>

          How It Works (Simplified)
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
         Users perform eco-actions (like planting a tree) and submit proof through the platform. An administrator reviews and verifies the proof. Once verified, the user is awarded Earthchain tokens. These tokens represent your contribution to a greener planet.
